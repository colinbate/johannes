# Johannes

Johannes is a web content system. It is designed to be a content renderer, as well as a content production system. However, the latter can be used without the former with a simple API.

It is designed to give the most freedom to the designer and developer of the site but also allow contextual editing of content for the content writer(s).

## Features / Ideas

 * Inline editing
 * Multiple content types
 ** Text section
 ** List (of links)
 ** More TBD
 * Markdown based syntax option
 * Very AJAX based, probably at most one page which is available out of context of the content itself
 * Potential to reuse content by linking it within multiple pages
 * Custom pages can be served from the file system if present
 * Multiple author support
 * Content versioning
 * Content curation (timed release, expiry, etc)
 * Content workflow

## Notes

This is a new project, born out of a frustration of using different content systems and not finding them able to answer my needs. Also as a chance to work on a node.js project in my (very minimal) spare time. 

I suspect that some of the content production features (multi author, workflow, etc.) will be done later as I don't have an immediate personal need for those things in my own sites.
